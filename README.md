# **Math Module**

This page documents the development of a custom **math module** that I created as part of my learning journey in Python. The goal of this module was to consolidate my understanding of Python functions, modules, and various mathematical operations. Below, I’ll explain the functionality of the module, how it works, and provide usage examples.

## **Overview of the Math Module**

The **math module** I created includes a variety of functions that perform basic and advanced mathematical operations. These operations range from simple arithmetic to more complex tasks like calculating factorials, powers, and even performing trigonometric calculations. The module serves as a useful learning tool and can also be used in more practical applications.
